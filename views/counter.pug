        h1 What is an exoplanet?
        h3 Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets are planets that have been detected <em>outside</em> of our solar system. 
        p The first exoplanets detected were two planets orbiting the pulsar 
            | PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksandr Wolszczan. In 1992, Aleksandr Wolszczan and Dale Frail published a paper named <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992Natur.355..145W/abstract'> A planetary system around the millisecond pulsar PSR1257+12.</a>
            | . In 1994, one more planet was discovered. As of writing, that planet is the smallest exoplanet observed, at about 2% of Earth's mass.
        h1 How are exoplanets found?
        h3 Radial Velocity Method 
        p Using the Radial Velocity Method, astronomers check if a nearby large planet is "wobbling" its parent star.
            | Researchers look for stars that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect#:~:text=The%20Doppler%20effect%20for%20electromagnetic%20waves%20such%20as,receding%20from%20us%3B%20that%20is%2C%20their%20radial%20velocities.">redshifting and blueshifting</a> on a regular interval, as the exoplanet 
            | is pushing and pulling the star, changing its relative velocity to Earth.

        h3 Transit Photometry
        p If an exoplanet's orbit happens to pass between Earth and the host star, the star's light is dimmed by a small amount. If this dip in brightness happens
            | on a regular interval, then there is an exoplanet orbiting that star. As of writing, this method has led to more discoveries of exoplanets than any 
            | other method.

    #projectInfo
        h1 About this project
        p I created this website from the ground up starting in June.
        p The site works by downloading a JSON with all the known exoplanet names from NASA, found at this link: <a href='https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/'> Exoplanet Archive.</a> The program then parses the JSON and uploads it to MongoDB. This is done every five minutes or so. 
            | Every time you refresh the page, the program counts the number of Exoplanet objects in the database.
            | In order to create this project, I had to completely learn:

            li Express
            li MongoDB and Mongoose
            li Heroku
            li Pug
        p As of August 9th 2021, the site is now fully available to the public.
